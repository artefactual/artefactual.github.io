About digital preservation
==========================

At Artefactual, we work in the context of archival standards.
This context informs the decisions we make for the software we develop
and maintain. 

The resources listed here can be specific to our own context, since there
are a diverse, broad range of archival traditions in the world. We believe
that the list presented here is a good first step to get started in the
digital preservation world. This list has been curated for beginners.

Digital preservation is for everyone
------------------------------------

This document is on resources about digital preservation and archives in
general. The goal is to help someone new to this world get familiar with
the concepts and ideas, not to replace a formal education on the topic.
This is not meant to be exhaustive.

What is digital preservation?
-----------------------------

Digital preservation is the set of actions, standards and processes involved
in making digital or digitalized content available in the future.

Digital preservation might involve standard IT storage solutios, with a layer
of additional needs to be met.

Getting started
---------------

The `Novice to Know-How: Digital Preservation for Beginners <know-how-beginners>`__ from the `Digital Preservation Coalition <dpc>`__ is one of the most thorough yet concise training on the topic. It covers file formats, bitstreams, workflows for preservation, and how to give access to preserved digital content. It will help you understand the risks associated with preserving digital content in the long term, from the material point of view.

Note that there is also a `DPC YouTube channel <dpc-youtube>`__.

Standards
---------

Our work is informed both by archival content standards and by metadata standards.

Metadata standards
``````````````````

Software developed at Artefactual is informed by the digital preservation standards, such as `PREMIS <premis>`__ and `METS <mets>`__. Both these websites contain learning materials, such as this `PREMIS list of tutorials <premis-tuto>`__ as well as `suggested readings for METS <mets-reading>`__.

Archivematica documentation has pages on `how PREMIS is supported in the software <premis-am>`__, and similarly for `METS in Archivematica <mets-am>`__.

Archival content standards
``````````````````````````

Some of the archival contents standards we are interested in includes the `Rules for Archival Description <rad>`__, the `DACS <dacs>`__ and `ISAD-G <isad-g>`__. Other standards might be of interest which are not listed here.

Technical challenges
--------------------

If you are curious about the technical challenges of preserving data and its metadata for the long term, consider reading about the `challenges faced by the CERN Digital Memory Platform <cern-challenges>`__, such as scaling, hardware failures, losing data because of software errors, and other ways that digital preservation can fail to happen. This thesis make use of Archivematica.

Learning to code
----------------

You would like to learn to program, and you are wondering which languages and tools would be the most useful? Here is `one answer from the Society of American Archivists <saa-code>`__, as well as an `insightful blog post on The Signal <signal-code>`__. Both contains general technologies used in digital preservation, as well as software and tools specific to the field.

Curious to see how programming is applied in practice? You might want to take a look at this `PyCon Ireland 2019 talk by Kieran O'Leary <pycon2019>`__, where the preservation of movie image heritage is discussed, presenting how Python was used to build tools.

The archival context
--------------------

Digital preservation is closely related to the archives world. How do they relate? Here are a few resources to help you gain a better understanding of the general context.

In `But Storage is Cheap: Digital Preservation in the Age of Abundance <abundance>`__, Abby Smith Rumsey highlights general challenges in establishing and implementing good digital preservation practices.

The `Theory and Craft of Digital Preservation by Trevor Owens <owens-en>`__ covers history of preservation and builds bridges to new media studies, acting as a guide to intentional, deliberate preservation. This book is `also available en español <owens-es>`__, in digital open access version.

We would also like to highlight the `DPC Digital Preservation Handbook <dpc-handbook>`__, as well as a `repository of case studies related to Archivematica <am-case-studies>`__.

Talks
-----

Many interesting talks on digital preservation have been made available online, such as `this one the Learn with Scholars Portal on digital preservation and what it looks like <digipres-portal>`__, and this `video of talk by Trevor Owens on communities and platform <owens-talk>`__.

And... many more!
------------------

This list was not meant to be exhaustive - here a few other links as a conclusion:

- `Unesco’s charter on the preservation of digital heritage <unesco-charter>`__ 
- `Sustainability of digital formats <sustain-formats>`__
- `Levels of digital preservation <levels>`__ to help you build or assess a program

If we missed something that was helpful to you on your digital preservation journey, consider `opening an issue to add it <issue>`__.
