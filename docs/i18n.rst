Internationalization
====================

One way you can get involved with our projects is through translation and localizations efforts, helping us reach a broader international audience by making meaningful, useful tools for digital preservation.

Here are the current efforts we help maintain for each project.

Acces to Memory (AtoM)
----------------------

Documentation
_____________

For the AtoM, here is `more information about contributing documentation translation <https://wiki.accesstomemory.org/wiki/Resources/Documentation/Contribute#Contribute_documentation_translations>`__.

User interface
______________

In AtoM documentation, there is a `Translate section <https://accesstomemory.org/docs/latest/#translate>`__ on how to translate both database contents and user interface elements in AtoM.

Archivematica
-------------

Documentation
_____________

At the moment speaking, there are some partial translations of Archivematica documentation, but no guidelines to follow for doing one. You will find the `.po files on GitHub <https://github.com/artefactual/archivematica-docs/tree/1.16/locale>`__.

User interface
______________

We are not currently working on translations for the Archivematica UI, in date of March 2024. You can `access previous documentation for translating the AM user interface <https://archivematica.org/docs/latest/user-manual/translations/translations/>`__.


Enduro
------

There is no current internationalization effort for Enduro.
