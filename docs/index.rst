Welcome!

Welcome to the Contributors Portal for Access to Memory (AtoM),
Archivematica and Enduro.

At `Artefactual <https://www.artefactual.com>`__, we are currently
working on improving the contribution process, and we deemed it useful
to have a Portal to group relevant information for our main
software projects.

This Portal was first created in May 2024. It is maintained as a 
`GitHub repo <https://www.github.com/artefactual/artefactual.github.io>`__.

Suggestions for this Portal are welcome - you can either `open an issue <https://www.github.com/artefactual/artefactual.github.io/issues>`__
or `send us an email <mailto:contributors@artefactual.com>`__.
