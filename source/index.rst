Why this Portal
---------------

At Artefactual, we are currently working on improving the contribution process, and we deemed useful to have a Portal to help regroup relevant information for our main software projects.

What is the Portal
------------------

The Portal is a way for Contributors to find information that will guide them through the contribution process for AtoM, Archivematica and Enduro.
